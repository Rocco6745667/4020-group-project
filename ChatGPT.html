        <h2>Research Approach</h2>
        <p>
          For this project, we utilized a modern tech stack to seamlessly
          integrate data storage, server-side logic, and AI capabilities.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            MongoDB: We used MongoDB as our database solution for efficient data
            management and storage. Its flexible document model allowed us to
            handle and query data related to our research on ChatGPT's
            performance.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Node.js: Node.js was chosen for the server-side setup, providing a
            robust runtime environment to handle backend operations, API
            requests, and data processing. It enabled us to create a responsive
            and scalable web application.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ChatGPT API: The ChatGPT API was a key tool in our research,
            allowing us to interact with ChatGPT programmatically. We used the
            API to conduct performance evaluations, automate responses, and
            collect data to analyze its efficiency across different use cases.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These technologies together formed the foundation of our project,
          ensuring smooth integration and efficient data flow from backend
          operations to front-end presentation.

        <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The overview of the dataset in respect to the accuracy of the queries
          in comparision to the expected answers were satisfactory. ChatGPT
          provided accurate answers in the datasets most of the time but not
          consistenty. There were instances where answers were inaccurate
          roughly 10% of the time in the sociology category of questions.
          Simiarly with computer security, and prehistory the answers were as
          accurate as previoiusly observed in the sociology category, how ever
          it took a few seconds longer to compute and was inaccurate 20% and 10%
          of the time respectively.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment combines web development with an in-depth evaluation
          of ChatGPT’s efficiency across various domains. You will create a
          website that documents your research, displays data visualizations,
          and provides insights on ChatGPT’s performance. This assignment will
          develop your skills in web design, API interaction, data handling, and
          presenting technical findings.
